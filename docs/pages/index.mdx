# Getting Started

## Qiuck Start

```bash
npx create-next-gen-react-app
cd <app-name>

npm run start
# or depending on choice
pnpm run start
```

> Browser will automatically open

## Get Started Immediately

Various common tools are preconfigured (ex. webpack, swc, jest, typescript, prettier), so you can focus on creating your project and immediately working on it.

## Creating an App

You'll need to have Node >= 16 on your local development machine (but itâ€™s not required on the server).

### npx

```bash
npx create-next-gen-react-app
```

## Scripts

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm run start` or `pnpm run start`

Runs the app in development mode. The browser will automatically be opened on localhost.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### `npm run test` or `pnpm run test`

By default runs all tests.
