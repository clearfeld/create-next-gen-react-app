# Adding a Sass Stylesheet

Generally, we recommend that you donâ€™t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a .Button CSS class in `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` components, we recommend creating a `<Button>` component with its own .Button styles, that both `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` can render (but not inherit).

Following this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable.

To use Sass, first install `sass`:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev sass sass-loader
# or
$ pnpm add -D sass sass-loader
```

Then add the following to your webpack.config files:

```ts {2,6}
{
    test: /\.(sa|sc|c)ss$/,
    use: [
        "style-loader",
        "css-loader",
        "sass-loader",
    ]
},
```

Now you can rename `src/App.css` to `src/App.scss` and update `src/App.tsx` to import src/App.scss. This file and any other file will be automatically compiled if imported with the extension `.scss` or `.sass`.

To share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass's `@use` rule. For example, `src/App.scss` and other component style files could include `@use "./shared.scss"`; with variable definitions.

This will allow you to do imports like

```scss
@use 'styles/_colors.scss'; // assuming a styles directory under src/
@use '~nprogress/nprogress'; // loading a css file from the nprogress node module
```

> Note: You can prefix paths with `~`, as displayed above, to resolve modules from `node_modules`.
