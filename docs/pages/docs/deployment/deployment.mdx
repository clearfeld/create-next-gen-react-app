# Deployment

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm run build
    ````
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ````bash copy
    pnpm build
    ````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Creates a `dist` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, `[name].bundle.css`, and the various `[name].bundle.js` files.

## Static server

The easiest way to test and handle this would be to install [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) and let it handle the rest:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm i -g serve
    serve -s dist
    ````
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ````bash copy
    pnpm add -g serve
    serve -s dist
    ````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The last command shown above will serve your static site on  http://localhost:3000. Like many of serveâ€™s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-l` or `--listen` flags:

```bash copy
serve -s build -l 4000
```

Run this command to get a full list of the options available:

```bash copy
serve -h
```
