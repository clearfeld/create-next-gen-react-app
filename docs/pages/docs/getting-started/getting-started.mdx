## Creating an App

You'll need to have Node >= 16 on your local development machine (but itâ€™s not required on the server).

### npx

```bash
npx create-next-gen-react-app@latest
```

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed. check the [deployment](/docs/deployment/deployment) section on how to test and next steps.
